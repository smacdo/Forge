Overview
==========
Forge is a simple networked game that allows players to chat and play
together in a frightening and untamed world. Forge is written in Qt and
is currently under heavy developement - work just started!

Please feel free to play around whenever you want. I'm developing this
game in my spare time to learn about Qt, networking design, and writing a
scriptable, highly data driven game. Basically, things are probably going
to break a lot, and won't be optimally written for a long time! But that's
OK, since its better to get it working and then get it right.

Please try the game out when you get a chance, and send some feedback!
User experience, game play and code design feedback is welcomed.

Contributions
=============
Contributions of all kinds are highly welcome. Please give the game a spin,
and if you feel like contributing ideas, artwork or code please contact me.
